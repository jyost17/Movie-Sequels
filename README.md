# Movie-Sequels
This dataset contains information about movie series and their sequels, exploring genres, ratings and run times across a range of movies. Potential applications of this data include which genres produce the most popular/best sequels, if there's any correlation between year gaps and ratings, and if there's a correlation between the number of sequels and how successful they are.
